# Music-App

## Brief Description  
The app attempts to serve as a music platform such as Spotify or
YouTube Music. It provides two perspectives, the one of an artist
that can upload albums of songs or podcasts with multiple episodes,
and one of a regular listener that can tune in to the content provided
on the platform and like a few songs
